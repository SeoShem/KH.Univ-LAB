# KH.Univ LAB

This is LAB of KH.Univ students in Korea.
We have grown lettuce and sesame leaf by using SmartFarm.

We'll give you our source to grow crops for arduino and growing process.
When we maintained humidity at 60%RH and give water every two days, crops grew well.

If you have any other good idea or question, please share them.
